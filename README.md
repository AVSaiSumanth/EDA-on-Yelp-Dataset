# EDA on Yelp Dataset

The data contains 3 main tables to analyze in addition to the territory abbreviation
file:
• yelp_academic_dataset_business.csv - contains information about a subset
of businesses having at least one Yelp review. Every distinct business has a
unique business_id
• yelp_academic_dataset_review.csv - contains a subset of Yelp reviews
with a business_id indicating what business the review is for and a user_id to
identify the user leaving the review
• yelp_academic_dataset_user.csv - contains a subset of Yelp users
identified by user_id
The data consists of several tables about some of the different observational units
that Yelp collects data about: users, reviews, businesses, check-ins, tips, and
photos. We will focus on the businesses with a Yelp listing, the Yelp users, and the
reviews they leave. The Yelp dataset is a subset of businesses, reviews, and user
data for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes.
